**Comparison between two state of the art methods in multivariate time series prediction for Panama electricity demand**
In 2023, two different approaches for time series predictions have been introduced:
-[Dlinea](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07125)
-[PatchTST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730)
These methods have been implemented on 8 popular time series datasets and showd that PatchTST have better result.
In this article PatchTST has been described and
