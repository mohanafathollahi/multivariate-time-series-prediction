**Comparison between two state of the art methods in multivariate time series prediction for Panama electricity demand**<br>
In 2023, two different approaches for time series predictions have been introduced:<br>
-[Dlinea](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07125)<br>
-[PatchTST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14730)<br>
In this article more detail about PatchTST has been provided and performance of these two approaches in [Panama Electricity Load Forecasting dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pateljay731/panama-electricity-load-forecasting/data) will be compared.

These methods have been implemented on 8 popular time series datasets and showd that PatchTST have better result.<br>
